AnimalKingdom

I wrote this code to model a simple classification of the kingdom Animalia using object oriented programming in javascript. 
Please see the attached images for reference purposes.

Kingdom Animalia is divided into 6; Arthropoda, Aves, Mammal, Reptile, Amphibian and Fish. 
Classes were made for each one and objects we're instantiated from them.

A base class was created for kingdom Animalia to house the attributes common to all the sub classes, 2 classes inherited from the parent class with one attribute each and finally the 6 classes inherited from those two and each one has attributes specific to them.

This model of Kingdom Animalia was prepared while adhering to the 4 main principles of OOP; Abstraction, encapsulation, Inheritance and Polymorphism. 
Within the code I left comments showing my use of each principle.

You should be greeted with the following if the code works as intended:

This is a simple classification for Kingdom Animalia:

	[Arthropoda{ 
	
    
	kingdom: 'Animalia',
    
	name: 'Arthropoda',
    
	backbone: 'have no backbone',
    
	bloodtemperature: 'cold blooded',
    
	summary: 'Arthropoda are cold blooded and have no backbone. Examples include Spiders and Scorpions.' },
    
	
  	Fish {
  
    kingdom: 'Animalia',
	
    name: 'Fish',
	
    backbone: 'have a backbone',
	
    bloodtemperature: 'cold blooded',
	
    summary: 'Fish are cold blooded and have a backbone. Examples include Sharks and Eels.'},
  
	
	Amphibia {
  
    kingdom: 'Animalia',
	
    name: 'Amphibia',
	
    backbone: 'have a backbone',
	
    bloodtemperature: 'cold blooded',
	
    summary: 'Amphibias are cold blooded and have a backbone. Examples include Newts and Toads.'},
	
  
  	Reptile {
  
    kingdom: 'Animalia',
	
    name: 'Reptile',
	
    backbone: 'have a backbone',
	
    bloodtemperature: 'cold blooded',
	
    summary: 'Reptiles are cold blooded and have a backbone. Examples include Crocodiles and Turtles.'},
	
  
  	AVES {
  
    kingdom: 'Animalia',
	
    name: 'AVES',
	
    backbone: 'have a backbone',
	
    bloodtemperature: 'warm blooded',
	
    summary: 'AVES are warm blooded and have a backbone. Examples include Ducks and Pigeons.'},
	
  
  	Mammal {
  
    kingdom: 'Animalia',
	
    name: 'Mammal',
	
    backbone: 'have a backbone',
	
    bloodtemperature: 'warm blooded',
	
    summary: 'Mammals are warm blooded and have a backbone. Examples include Sheep and Humans.'}]
